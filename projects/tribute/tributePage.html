        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born
        October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong),
        Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the
        development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He
        soon moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was
        project director of the SLV-III, India’s first indigenously designed and
        produced satellite launch vehicle. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned
        the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped
        earned him the nickname “Missile Man.” From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was
        scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as
        principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank
        of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear
        weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests
        caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put
        forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he
        described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to
        a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other
        measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology
        as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and
        education. In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put
        forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan.
        Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though
        he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even
        the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed
        his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s
        11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He remained
        committed to using science and technology to transform India into a
        developed country. In 2007 Kalam left office and was succeeded by
        Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president. Kalam wrote several
        books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his
        numerous awards were two of the country’s highest honours, the Padma
        Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).
